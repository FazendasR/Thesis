Thus, the study cycle is suitable for all students who wish to obtain in-depth training in the most recent techniques of data science and artificial intelligence, based on automatic logical reasoning, data management methods and techniques, as well as machine learning applications. The course aims to train highly specialized professionals who will enable organizations to take advantage of the huge volume of data they currently have at their disposal. Program Goals The bachelor's degree in Data Science aims to strengthen the intermediate step between data collection and decision making based on them, i.e. to develop advanced methods of data science and artificial intelligence. To this end, the course of study adopts a primarily technical perspective. The goal is to provide in-depth knowledge of the fundamental methodologies and concepts, in order to provide the student with the ability to update more specific technical knowledge and to keep up with the rapid evolution of this sector. In this context, the graduate in Data Science should: Understand the theoretical foundations of statistics, Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence methods; Identify and understand the most efficient algorithm for each specific problem; Design and develop state-of-the-art data science algorithms; Work closely with IT specialists to integrate Data Science algorithms into existing systems; Identify underlying patterns and extract useful information from the large volume of heterogeneous data that exists in organizations; Be proficient in commonly used statistical procedures, frameworks, machine learning techniques and systems; Stimulate interest in keeping up with scientific advances in the field of Data Science and Artificial Intelligence. Program Structure The course lasts 3 years (6 semesters) and classes start in September 2025.
