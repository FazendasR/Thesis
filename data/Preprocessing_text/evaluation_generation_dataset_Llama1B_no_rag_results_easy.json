      "question": "Can I pursue a Master's in Data Science after completing a Bachelor's in Economics?",
      "reference_answer": [
        "Yes, you can pursue a Master's in Data Science after completing a Bachelor's in Economics. The Master’s programs in Data Science and Advanced Analytics are interdisciplinary and designed to equip students with skills in handling large databases, data mining, predictive modeling, and decision-making processes. Your economics background, which likely includes quantitative and analytical training, fits well with these programs, especially since data science relies heavily on such skills. While the documents don't explicitly list specific prerequisites, economics is commonly considered a suitable foundation for entering data science at the master’s level."
