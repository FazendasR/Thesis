      "reference_answer": [
        "The Bachelors in Data Science curriculum in the second semester of the first year is structured with a strong emphasis on practical learning, though it includes essential theoretical components. Most courses combine theoretical and practical teaching formats, particularly in subjects like algorithms, artificial intelligence, computational thinking, and statistics, which are delivered through sessions labeled as TP (theoretical/practical) or PL (practical laboratory). Purely theoretical instruction is limited and primarily found in the mathematical analysis courses. Overall, the semester prioritizes hands-on application and real-world problem-solving, while theoretical learning is integrated where foundational understanding is necessary."
      ],
      "generated_answer": [
        "## Step 1: Identify the key components of a typical data science curriculum.\nA typical data science curriculum includes both theoretical and practical aspects. Theoretical components focus on understanding the concepts, principles, and methods involved in data science, while practical components involve hands-on experience with tools, techniques, and projects.\n\n## Step 2: Determine the specific emphasis on theoretical vs practical learning in the Bachelors in Data Science curriculum.\nIn most data science curricula, there's an equal or greater emphasis on theoretical learning compared to practical learning. This means that students typically spend more time studying the underlying theories, algorithms, and statistical models rather than just applying them to real-world problems.\n\n## Step 3: Consider how the second semester of the Bachelor's program might be structured for data science.\nGiven the emphasis on theoretical learning, the second semester of the Bachelor's program in data science would likely include more lectures, discussions, and readings focused on advanced topics such as machine learning, deep learning, natural language processing, and data visualization. Practical projects may still be part of the curriculum but would be less prominent due to the increased theoretical foundation.\n\n## Step 4: Assess whether the practical component remains significant throughout the second semester.\nWhile the practical component might not be as dominant as it was during the first semester, it would still play a role. Students might participate in group projects, work on personal datasets, or engage in hackathons to apply their knowledge in a more applied manner. However, these activities would be designed to reinforce theoretical concepts rather than solely serve as practical exercises.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{Theoretical}$"

It also introduces probability distributions, such as the normal distribution, binomial distribution, and Poisson distribution, which are essential tools for data analysis and modeling.\nThe course syllabus includes topics like:\n* Introduction to statistics and probability\n* Descriptive statistics: mean, median, mode, variance, standard deviation\n* Inferential statistics: hypothesis testing, confidence intervals, regression analysis\n* Probability distributions: normal distribution, binomial distribution, Poisson distribution\n* Statistical inference: confidence intervals, hypothesis testing, regression analysis\n* Applications of statistics and probability in data science\n\nBased on this information, we can estimate that Statistics and Probability Distributions would likely be worth around 20-25 ECTS points, assuming an average of 22.5 ECTS per course.\n\nPlease note that this is just an estimate and may vary depending on individual circumstances, such as course load, attendance, and assessment methods."

So, the calculation will be $1,500 (tuition) + $800 (enrollment).\n\n## Step 2: Perform the addition for first-year students' costs\n$1,500 + $800 = $2,300.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the total cost for second-year students\nSimilarly, to find the total cost for second-year students, we add the tuition fee and the enrollment fee together. So, the calculation will be $2,000 (tuition) + $800 (enrollment).\n\n## Step 4: Perform the addition for second-year students' costs\n$2,000 + $800 = $2,800.\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the total cost for third-year students\nAgain, to find the total cost for third-year students, we add the tuition fee and the enrollment fee together. So, the calculation will be $3,000 (tuition) + $800 (enrollment).\n\n## Step 6: Perform the addition for third-year students' costs\n$3,000 + $800 = $3,800.\n\n## Step 7: Summarize the total costs for each year\nFirst-year students pay a total of $2,300, second-year students pay a total of $2,800, and third-year students pay a total of $3,800.\n\n## Step 8: Since the problem asks for the total cost without specifying which year's students are being asked about, we'll provide the most comprehensive answer by including all years in one final statement.\n\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{9300}$"
