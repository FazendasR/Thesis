A Master's in Data Science program would cover topics such as:\n\n* Data preprocessing and visualization\n* Machine learning algorithms\n* Statistical modeling\n* Data mining\n* Big data technologies\n\nArtificial Intelligence, on the other hand, focuses more on developing intelligent systems that can perform tasks that typically require human intelligence, such as visual perception, speech recognition, decision-making, and language translation. AI programs might delve deeper into areas like:\n\n* Deep learning\n* Natural Language Processing (NLP)\n* Computer vision\n* Robotics\n\nWhile some data science applications may overlap with AI, a degree in AI is not a prerequisite for pursuing a Master's in Data Science. However, having a background or coursework in AI could be beneficial if you're interested in specializing in areas like machine learning or NLP within data science.\n\nTo increase your chances of being accepted into a Master's in Data Science program without an AI background, focus on:\n\n1. Developing strong programming skills in languages like Python, R, or SQL.\n2. Building a portfolio of projects showcasing your ability to work with data and extract insights.\n3. Highlighting relevant coursework or certifications in statistics, mathematics, computer science, or information technology.\n4.

We will use 125 credits as an average to calculate the total cost.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the total tuition fee for undergraduate programs\nUsing the given tuition fee of $1,500 per credit hour, we can calculate the total tuition fee for undergraduate programs by multiplying the number of credits (125) by the tuition fee ($1,500).\n\nTotal tuition fee = Number of credits * Tuition fee per credit hour\nTotal tuition fee = 125 * $1,500\nTotal tuition fee = $187,500\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the total tuition fee for graduate programs\nSince there is no information about the specific program being taken by the students, we cannot determine whether they are taking an undergraduate or graduate program. However, assuming that all students are taking a graduate program, we can calculate the total tuition fee using the graduate program tuition fee.\n\nTotal tuition fee = Number of credits * Tuition fee per credit hour\nTotal tuition fee = 125 * $2,000\nTotal tuition fee = $250,000\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the total enrollment fee\nThe enrollment fee is $200 per student. Assuming there are 125 students, we can calculate the total enrollment fee.\n\nTotal enrollment fee = Number of students * Enrollment fee per student\nTotal enrollment fee = 125 * $200\nTotal enrollment fee = $25,000\n\n## Step 5: Determine the overall cost for both scenarios\nWe have two possible scenarios: one where all students take an undergraduate program and another where all students take a graduate program. The overall cost would be the sum of the total tuition fee and the total enrollment fee.\n\nScenario 1: Undergraduate programs\nOverall cost = Total tuition fee + Total enrollment fee\nOverall cost = $187,500 + $25,000\nOverall cost = $212,500\n\nScenario 2: Graduate programs\nOverall cost = Total tuition fee + Total enrollment fee\nOverall cost = $250,000 + $25,000\nOverall cost = $275,000\n\nHowever, since the problem does not specify which scenario applies, we should note that without further information, it is impossible to provide a definitive answer.\n\nGiven the format requirements, I'll select the most expensive scenario as the final answer:\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{275000}$"
