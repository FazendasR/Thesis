        "reference_answer": ["The Bachelors in Data Science is structured over 6 semesters (3 years), with a strong emphasis on technical and practical learning. The first 5 semesters (150 ECTS) consist of mandatory courses that blend theoretical (T) and theoretical/practical (TP, PL) instruction formats, indicating a mix of conceptual grounding and hands-on application. The final semester (30 ECTS) offers optional courses, allowing students to tailor their learning based on interest or specialization. Overall, the program balances theoretical understanding with applied, practice-oriented training from the start."],
        "generated_answer": ["From the retrieved context, the Bachelors in Data Science is structured across six semesters. The first five semesters are mandatory and consist of a mix of theoretical and practical learning.\n\nIn the second semester, students take courses such as \"Show subtitles T – Theoretical Teaching; TP – Theoretical/ Practical Teaching;\" which indicate that there is both theoretical and practical teaching in this semester. Specifically, students are required to complete both theoretical and practical assignments for these courses.\n\nIn the third semester, students take courses such as \"Mathematical Analysis I\" and \"Mathematical Analysis II,\" which are primarily theoretical in nature. Students are expected to master the mathematical concepts covered in these courses through rigorous theoretical study.\n\nIn the fourth semester, students take courses such as \"Statistics and Probability Distributions,\" which is a primarily practical course focused on teaching students how to apply statistical methods to real-world data. Students are expected to gain hands-on experience with statistical software tools and techniques through completing practical assignments for this course.\n\nIn the fifth semester, students take courses such as \"Introduction to Artificial Intelligence\" and \"Show subtitles T – Theoretical Teaching; TP – Theoretical/ Practical Teaching,\" which indicate that there is both theoretical and practical teaching in these courses. Specifically, students are required to complete both theoretical and practical assignments for these courses.\n\nIn the sixth semester, students take elective courses based on their individual interests and career goals. These courses may be primarily theoretical or primarily practical in nature, depending on the specific course content and learning objectives. Students are expected to choose elective courses that will help them develop the skills and knowledge necessary to achieve their long-term career goals.\n\nIn summary, the Bachelors in Data Science is structured across six semesters, with the first five semesters being mandatory and consisting of a mix of theoretical and practical learning. The sixth semester is dedicated to elective courses based on individual interests and career goals. Throughout the program, students are expected to develop a strong foundation in both theoretical and practical aspects of data science, as well as the ability to apply this knowledge to real-world problems and situations."
