The capital of Slovenia, Ljubljana, is a relatively large central European city situated between the Alps and the Adriatic Sea with approximately 300,000 inhabitants.
It is the political and cultural heart of the Slovenian nation and most charming in summer. The visitor's first impression of Ljubljana is that it is an exceptionally young city as over 50,000 students provide very young vibrations. Many scientists come to Ljubljana because of its university and institutes with solid international reputations.
It's a city of culture and a rich historical legacy which offers all the friendliness of a small town and at the same time everything that a capital city should offer.
