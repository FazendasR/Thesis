The choice of a postgraduate degree in Digital Enterprise Management was a natural one, given that I had been managing projects for several years, but I wanted to improve my skills in the great challenge of Digital Transformation. I couldn't have made a better choice. Despite being very demanding, the support of professors and colleagues has made this postgraduate course in Digital Enterprise Management a real training tool.

The group assignnments, in which different case studies from well-known companies are analyzed, allow the creation of a state of alert for the challenges that an organization faces during its digital transformation, which is an asset for those who want to make a difference in a world with an increasingly digital focus.

With a practical approach, focused on problem-solving and an academic environment of excellence, with great proximity between teachers and students, NOVA IMS was a school of enormous importance in my development, the right choice for what would be my professional future.
Choosing the postgraduate program in Digital Enterprise Management of NOVA IMS was the right decision in a context of change within organizations. The digital transformation is a big challenge and this is a great opportunity to reposition the business world and prepare it for tomorrow. Now more than ever: no one expected the future to come so soon and in such a challenging way. The possibility of learning in a practical way and in group, using real business simulations, is an asset in a program like this, created in a prestigious college together with excellent international partners.
Having been a student at NOVA IMS in a postgraduate and Master degree programs was an excellent decision. There is a highly prepared and demanding faculty that, in addition to their professional experience, together with the work carried out with colleagues, allowed me to obtain a level of deep theoretical and practical knowledge in this new world, increasingly computerized, digital and accelerating transformation with business impact. Another great advantage was the increase in the diversified networking, which is very important today. Without a doubt, it was a great experience with a very positive feedback that will help me to be better prepared for the challenges of the present and the future.

Also, the close connection of the professors between academia and the real world of business, the partnerships and the different backgrounds and industries of the colleagues, give us a great opportunity to learn and share knowledge activating our collective brain.
It was a great experience!
