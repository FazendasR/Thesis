I joined this master's program after completing a Post-graduation in Smart and Sustainable Cities so that I could deepen my technical capacity to plan and execute this kind of urban data project. From the very beginning of my experience, I learned from many excellent instructors who provided concrete case studies and projects to complement their lectures. I was regularly challenged yet supported throughout my academic experience, and had the freedom to pursue projects of my own design to consolidate my learning. I was extremely lucky to have Professor Marco Painho as my thesis advisor, who not only provided thorough guidance, but also arranged for additional direction from other specialized professors to help me realize and deliver my thesis project. Ever since, I have continued to benefit from the resources of my alma mater, both enjoying access to the facilities, programs and minds that are helping me to transform my final project into a new business.
NOVA IMS surprised me by offering a pleasant academic and professional experience. The high level of quality and demand of the Master's gave me the opportunity to generate even more value for my projects, clients and business partners. Thanks to this environment of synergy and exchange of knowledge, I have won awards and notable achievements for my career. Thank you very much NOVA IMS.
In order to raise the quality of geospatial challenges in my work, I joined the Master Program in Geographic Information Systems and Science, which allows me to assimilate knowledge in a clear way and to open new horizons, while also provides the necessary tools to improve in this area. The international aspect provides an enriching exchange of experiences.
The Master Program in Geographic Information Systems and Science focuses on the analysis, management and visualization of geospatial information, fundamental methods in a global and digital world. Geoinformation is transversal to all sciences and activities (economy, health, security) and its study motivates innovative approaches and the generation of new knowledge
When I was looking for a program in Geographic Information Systems that would allow me to grow and deepen knowledge, combining a solid theoretical training with a strong practical component, the Master Degree Program in Geographic Information Systems and Science came to me as “the reference". Exceeded expectations! The e-learning format, despite some initial skepticism, allowed me to manage the issue of distance and availability, in no way compromising the rigor and the demand. On the contrary. I found a diversified offer, with a faculty of recognized professional and academic merit, whose support was decisive for the completion of the program. Better yet, NOVA IMS’ experience and follow-up continue well beyond the end of the program!
Quality, rigorous, targeted and very up-to-date teaching.
The Master Degree Program in Geographic Information Systems and Science offered me new perspectives and ideas to be able to apply in reality.
It was/is worth it.
The way they address the relevant issues in terms of subjects such as Environment, Spatial Planning and Urban Planning, as a resource to geographic information technologies, in addition to their contribution to society through scientific research, makes this Master Degree Program the most relevant at national level, which I felt proud to be part of!
The Master Degree Program in Geographic Information Systems and Science stands out for its innovative and differentiating curriculum, considering what organizations want for their staff and introducing very current topics.
The Master Program in Geographic Information Systems and Science, with an internationally recognized academic quality and associated with the availability of the latest technologies, is the best option to be at the forefront of Geographic Information Systems.
The best Master Degree Program in Geographic Information Systems in Portugal.
The excellent international partners, the teaching staff and the learning materials are a differential and valuable factor that allowed me to start an academic and professional career in this area.
