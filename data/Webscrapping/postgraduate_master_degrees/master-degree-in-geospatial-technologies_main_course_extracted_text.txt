Living in Münster and Castellón
Münster is a city that keeps its history alive. Houses, churches and squares in the restored old town “tell” tales from different centuries, all the while setting a stage that makes every visit in Münster an experience. You can comfortably reach many of the most important tourist features in Münster by foot or by bike from the Prinzipalmarkt.
Around the historical center of Münster you got the so called green lung “Promenade”. It has a length of 4.5 km round way. The Promenade is also where the huge flea market takes part in summer time every third Saturday between May and September.
From the “Promenade” you can easily reach the lake “Aasee” which has a size of 40.2 Hektar and with a length of 2.3 km. The lake is surrounded by local parks and is the biggest local recreation area of Münster. Next to the Promenade you also see the castle, where you find the departments of the Westfälische Wilhelms-Universität. Behind the castle there is a beautiful botanical garden.
On Wednesdays and Saturdays the townsfolk of Münster love to go to the Market which takes place on the “Domplatz” from 7.30am to 2.30pm. You find different booths with a special flair.
For the nightlife people usually go to the old town “Kuhviertel” with its different pubs and restaurants. They also love to go to the harbor, where you find Cafes, Restaurants, a big Cinema as well as Clubs.
So, come and enjoy Münster & spend a great time here!
Castellón de la Plana
Castellón de la Plana,the capital of the province of Castellon, is a town with 175,000 inhabitants, although if the small towns that make up the surrounding metropolitan area are included then the total comes to almost half a million people. It is a pleasant, sunlit town that lies between the Desert de les Palmes hills and the Mediterranean Sea, and is surrounded by orange groves. Industrial development in the area is dominated by a strong ceramics sector. The city is situated 65 km north of Valencia and 285 south of Barcelona.
Castellón has grown in recent years to become one of the most high-profile places in the Valencian Community and Spain. The University, the Conference Centre and Auditorium, the Fine Arts Museum, the Marina and the Planetarium are all evidence of the economic and cultural growth and development of this Mediterranean town.
The main popular festivals in the town are the Magdalena, which is celebrated in March, and Saint Peter’s festival, which takes place in El Grau de Castellón in June.
The province of Castellón mixes seaside and mountain landscapes. Along the coast, the landscape combines large areas of orange groves with 120 km of excellent beaches bathed by the calm waters of the Mediterranean Sea. Inland, the landscape changes dramatically – the province of Castellón is the second most mountainous in Spain and its inland areas have a rich cultural, historical and landscape heritage.
Geomundus
GeoMundus is a symposium on different Geoscience disciplines including, but not limited to, Geography, Earth and Environmental Studies, Geographic Information Science and Geoinformatics, Agriculture, Ecology and Environment, Disaster Management, and any other area in the broad field of Geoscience.
This conference is organized by the students from the consortium of Erasmus Mundus (EM) International Master's program in Geospatial Technologies. It is a conference that is free of charge and organized by students and for students. The conference will have participants from more than 25 countries and is also an opportunity to hear from expert speakers from different fields of Geoscience.
An important objective of this conference is to provide opportunities for the interchange of young researchers approaching academic and job market worlds by favoring networking between young researchers and professionals in geo-related sciences and industries. In order to achieve this objective, GeoMundus will be a scientific conference with peer-reviewed papers and posters, where young researchers present and discuss their work during the presentation sessions. They will have the opportunity to learn from and connect with their peers and innovators in various domains.

Following my degree in Information Systems and Technologies - where I discovered the fascinating area of Geospatial Technologies - and due to the prestige of NOVA IMS, the choice of this master's degree came naturally and immediately. The diversity of topics covered in the program has made this experience continually stimulating. The format of the theoretical-practical curricular units, with a strong focus on group projects, involved me in a real and tangible experience with the theoretical concepts. Moreover, studying in a multicultural environment and with strong professionals has given me a valuable perspective that transcends borders.
The Geospatial Technology Erasmus Master's Program, has been a transformative experience. Throughout the course, I have gained a solid grounding in the vast field of geospatial technology and became part of an exceptional business and academic network. This journey also provided me with the opportunity to enhance my programming skills, and I now have the confidence and knowledge to work in most geospatial roles. Ultimately, the most rewarding aspect of this experience has been the substantial knowledge I acquired. It has been a unique and invaluable journey.
The Master Program in Geospatial Technologies provides world-wide knowledge and practical skills, and prepares one to take on tasks in any global work environment. It includes a blend of inspiring international students and outstanding mentors, creating an intellectually challenging environment.
The in-depth knowledge of the lecturers and the practical applications of the program in diverse fields are the highlights of the Master Program in Geospatial Technologies. I also like the multi-cultural environments and how easy you can access the lecturers for any help or explanation of topics you are finding difficult to grasp.
The Erasmus Mundus Master in Geospatial Technologies provides the technical knowledge for a great career in the geospatial sector in a uniquely diverse, international and challenging environment.
The Master Program in Geospatial Technologies is an unique blend of theory and practice of GI Science. The training can easily be adapted to any location-based field of study. For me, its building ability is simply life changing as it inspires you to further delve into GI Science on your own.
The Master Program in Geospatial Technologies is definitely a great gateway to cutting-edge knowledge in geographic information science, remote sensing, GIS, and geographic data analysis, allowing to solve countless problems where the spatial context is relevant and essential.
Having chosen to study in the Master Program in Geospatial Technologies has been an excellent decision for my professional career, as it is providing me the opportunity to specialize in the field of geoinformatics while improving my soft skills in a very unique international environment.
The Master Program in Geospatial Technologies is a great start for your career in space! You'll learn to derive insights using geolocation, satellite imagery, and machine learning to deliver visually compelling results.
The broad positioning in the field of geospatial technologies coupled with deeper insights into a variety of applications is outstanding, along with its international students from diverse professional backgrounds.
