I found out about this master's program through a recommendation from a professional in the field. The opportunity to attend a high level distance learning master's course, that covers relevant and up-to-date aspects of Geographic Information Systems, allowed me to balance the demands of professional life with the course activities. Now, by sharing this testimony, I also hope to recommend it to aspiring students who wish to acquire theoretical and practical skills in the collection, storage, analysis, management and visualization of geospatial data. The faculty of the program was attentive to the needs and curricular situation of the master's students. In addition, I benefited from the services of the library team, which promptly provided me with articles and papers that I couldn't access through conventional searches.
I had the opportunity to join this master's program, and I must admit that it was a pleasant discovery. The possibility of taking the course online, makes it possible to balance personal and professional life with academic pursuits, allowing the acquisition of essential knowledge for career development. The professors are highly qualified. As a very participative student, I initially thought that an online course might not work very well. However, I have to say that I was pleasantly surprised; the classes were very dynamic, and the professors were available.
Additionally, the university's recognition and prestige give students a certain comfort and confidence, and boost their careers. The university also offers a range of services to help introduce students to the professional world, including webinars, fairs, and alumni mentoring programs.
20 years after I first enrolled in higher education, I decided to take a step forward and invest in my education and career. Analyzing current job offers in the GIS field revealed that mastering GIS software alone is not enough; analytical skills, as well as proficiency in databases and programming, are required. In this context, I sought a master's program with an updated curriculum, flexible enough to balance with work. I quickly concluded that, within the portuguese educational offerings, the program at NOVA IMS best met my expectations, offering a promising professional path. After one semester, I reflect positively on this master's degree, which has been both challenging and rewarding, allowing me to explore new techniques and methodologies. I look forward with anticipation to the contents of the next semester and to the construction of my thesis.
