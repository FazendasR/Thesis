Once I decided to specialize in the application of Geographical Information for defense and security purposes, the postgraduate program in Geospatial Intelligence at NOVA IMS, certified by the United States Geospatial Intelligence Foundation (USGIF), was the clear path for me to follow. The contents of this course, combined with the quality and know-how of the professors, were clearly a major factor in determining my career development. The course changed my life, and it all started at NOVA IMS.
