The Postgraduate Program allowed me to consolidate and deepen skills in very diverse areas, including management, budget policy and process, auditing, control, financial reporting, statistical methods, and public procurement, which is why I strongly encourage enrollment in this postgraduate program.
The Postgraduate Program in Financial and Budgetary Management and Control was assumed as an asset for presenting the new trends and best market practices, allowing an update of relevant knowledge for the performance of functions in the financial and budgetary scope.
I highlight the adherence of the training provided in a theoretical-practical aspect in areas of management of European Funds, on the proper implementation of internal control systems, management control and applicability of statistical methods in audit verifications.
I would also like to highlight the quality of the staff and the balance achieved between the participation of professors from the academy and senior officials from the Audit Authority (IGF).
The Postgraduate program in Financial and Budgetary Management and Control allowed me to reinforce my skills and acquire new knowledge, essential for the performance of my duties in the context of strategic control of the State's financial administration. The quality of the teachers and the interaction with the professional experiences of the other colleagues made the experience more enriching.
The exercise of audit functions requires the continuous updating of knowledge and methodologies.
The Postgraduate Program in Financial and Budgetary Management and Control answers to this requirement with a program focused on professional needs, valued by the different experiences of
the students and through academic excellence and deep practical knowledge of the subjects by the faculty.
The subjects covered in the program, adequate to our professional activity, are  a real asset for the organization and allowed us to strengthen and deepen specific knowledge for our daily performance. The contact and share with the colleagues from other institutions, who often work with us, made it possible to create a common space of understanding beyond the perception of this interconnectivity. It is worth highlighting the relationship with teachers, who made it possible to understand and deepen many of the challenges that arise in our daily professional lives, sharing with us solutions and forms of action. Participating in the Postgraduate Program in Financial and Budgetary Management and Control proved to be an enriching and remarkable experience in our professional paths.
NOVA IMS’ postgraduate program in Financial and Budget Management and Control seemed to me an unmissable opportunity from the moment I was introduced to its curriculum structure. Once the program was finished, I find myself equipped with undeniable technical advantages for the future development of my functional skills, and the beneficiary of the relational exchange I developed with colleagues from other entities.
