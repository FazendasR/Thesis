There's a chapter in my life before and after this postgraduate program. During my time at NOVA IMS I gained new perspectives in the realm of information management and security, deeply influenced by an understanding of the challenges related to globalization, which affect everyone - from states and organizations to regional dynamics and, most importantly, individuals. The subjects covered in this program were instrumental in realizing that each of us plays a vital role. Now, more than ever, it is crucial for us to take action to protect our societies and contribute to the advancement of humanity.
As a student at NOVA IMS, I felt warmly welcomed, surrounded by an incredible environment created by the people who represent the university, including professors, academic services, administration, security, and other essential services, all of which motivated us to pursue our objectives.

This postgraduate course has been very enriching, providing me not only with contacts, but also with enhanced knowledge about the issues that surround me, and that cross border barriers.  Right from the start, I was captivated by the innovative approach and academic excellence of this educational institution. The lecturers, experts in the fields of intelligence, security and international relations, provided an unparalleled learning environment. The integration of practical and current cases in class allowed me to better understand global dynamics.  The Cybersecurity UC was fundamental to understanding the security challenges that technologies have brought and to deepening good practices for protecting digital information.
My choice for this program was primarily aimed at deepening knowledge related to the role of intelligence in strategic decision-making in the areas of security and defense, but the fact that the faculty follows a multidisciplinary theoretical-practical approach opened up horizons for me in a broader spectrum of the business world.
The Postgraduate Program in Intelligence Management and Security allowed me to acquire new knowledge in the field of intelligence and provided the essential tools and techniques for the decision-making process in the field of criminal action.
