This postgraduate allowed me to consolidate my knowledge of markets and their financial aspects, considering my background in chemical engineering. I learned to better understand how these markets and financial flows work and to apply financial products/tools to mitigate risks. I highlight the strong practical component of this course and the experience of the faculty, which enabled us to better understand the thematic content of the course and its practical application. I also emphasize the use of machine learning and other digital tools, which make this course very up-to-date and prepared for current and future challenges.
Finally, and considering that I work for a large national company (Galp), where financial markets and risk (or risk mitigation) are daily tasks and challenges, the knowledge acquired will allow me to make and/or support decisions in a more informed and robust way to generate more value for the company. I have already recommended the course to some colleagues and friends.
The Postgraduate Program in Financial Markets and Risks provides a comprehensive overview of the main assets in the market and their characteristics, as well as the identification and implementation of techniques for the analysis and management of financial risks. Let us note you that this postgraduate degree covers much of the material included in the Financial Risk Manager (FRM) Part I and II Program, making it an excellent choice for future professional development. Finally, the quality and availability of the faculty is another important major plus.
The Postgraduate Program in Financial Markets and Risks stands out for its comprehensiveness, considering the perspective of the several players in the market and linking theoretical concepts with the reality. An excellent investment for those who are considering professional development in this area.
The study plan of the Postgraduate Program in Financial Markets and Risks offers a comprehensive and comprehensive training on capital markets and risk analysis and management. The faculty is highly prestigious with a focus on framing content in a real context in order to provide students with a perspective close to what they may find in their professional lives.
