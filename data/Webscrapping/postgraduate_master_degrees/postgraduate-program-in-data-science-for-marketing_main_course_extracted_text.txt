The master's degree that catapults theoretical knowledge of Marketing with a focus on the quantitative side. This course allows students to acquire knowledge of programming and statistics, always with a focus on Marketing. There is an awareness on the part of the lecturers towards students who don't come from a quantitative background, and they try to provide a creative, user-friendly experience, and a path for students to feel comfortable in this new field. I have nothing but good things to say about this university. Studying at NOVA IMS was one of the best choices I've made!
NOVA IMS offers a great experience for International students.
The quality of teaching is exceptional and qualified, which means that the programs are demanding and not easy, but you still allowed time to have fun and enjoy Portugal. I am very pleased with my experience, and I have learned a lot.
NOVA IMS was definitely the right decision in my academic career.
The postgraduate program in Data Science for Marketing offers the perfect combination of theory and practice, combined with a high quality faculty, crucial factors in choosing this program. It helped me to acquire a set of tools necessary to evolve professionally, offering me a holistic view of the world
of information technology and marketing. I am convinced that it was undoubtedly an asset and it had a very positive return.
