I can say with certainty that the course is not only recognized, but also acts as an incentive and investment in its students. The postgraduate course in Enterprise Data Science and Analytics has provided me with unique and extremely useful tools for my professional career, I can have a 360º view of the data cycle, and have good discussions with the various stakeholders (data engineers, data analysts and even directors). The combination of theoretical topics with practical applications is an excellent component of the course and a way of showing us our future in this field and preparing us to face the challenges we may face.
This postgraduate program was the perfect match allowing me to enhance my business, analytical and programming skills to broader challenges in an ever-evolving digital enterprise environment.
It offers a solid theoretical and hands-on experience covering Python, R and SQL programming languages, Data Science and Machine Learning, and leveraging Big Data & Cloud analytics to solve real enterprise challenges.
