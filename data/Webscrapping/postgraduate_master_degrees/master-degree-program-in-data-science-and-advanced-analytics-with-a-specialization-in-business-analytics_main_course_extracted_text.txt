The course offered me excellent technical tools in the field of Data Science. These resources allow any professional to stand out and get better opportunities in organizations.
The specialization in Business Analytics was my choice to change my career path into data analysis.
The program is well structured, innovative, and covers a wide range of topics that are required when looking for a job in this area. The curriculum tackles a theoretical approach and an application to real life through group projects. It’s also a big opportunity to meet people from all over the world for its internationality.
The Master Degree Program in Data Science & Advanced Analytics allowed me to learn about the main ways of working with one of the most important resources today: data. It had a very practical component, which was enhanced by the possibility of entering a curricular internship that allowed me to have a realistic perspective of the current challenges of organizations, in addition to have direct contact with professionals in the field.
The Master Degree Program in Advanced Analytics focuses on learning and developing optimized solutions to respond to new and demanding analytical problems. The multidisciplinary and international scope, the constant updating of relevant topics in the market and the teaching excellence make this program a unique and peculiarly unique experience in the academic context.
NOVA IMS is the right school to create skills suited to one of the biggest challenges today: extracting useful information from data from different domains, from social networks to hospitals. It is a faculty that opens windows of opportunity and leads us to success.
