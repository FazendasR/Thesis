My PhD at NOVA IMS was an intense, transforming, and extremely rewarding journey. NOVA IMS stands at the forefront of academic excellence and practical relevance, and its close relationship with industry and government bodies made it a clear choice for my doctoral studies. This doctoral program strikes an excellent balance of academic rigor, industry relevance, and expert mentorship.
The challenges posed throughout this experience were immense. Demanding research, and the constant push towards innovation were always hallmarks of this program, and the curriculum was carefully designed to foster critical thinking.
I could not go without thanking Prof. Mauro Castelli for his invaluable support, guidance, and experience. He was a crucial pillar of my success.
The NOVA IMS Doctoral Program in Information Management provided me with an invaluable experience and new way of thinking that indelibly has been shaping my journey as an executive in the business software industry. Sponsored by Microsoft my research was mainly focused on how analytics, collaboration and use contributes to enterprise applications value. Partnering with international researchers and under the supervision of Prof. Tiago Oliveira and Prof. Miguel Neto my research was published across five high-impact journals. A few years later joined SAP to promote the adoption of in-memory computing by enterprises.
The PhD in Information Management at NOVA IMS was an enriching experience. NOVA IMS, which stands out for its academic excellence, provided me with a solid foundation in data science and information management that complemented my professional experience in Competitive Intelligence, which is essential in today's marketplace. The professors and experts in these fields, as well as the access to academic resources, allowed me to explore new frontiers of knowledge, publish in top scientific journals, and lay the foundation for Competitive Intelligence Science. This program has not only prepared me for new professional challenges, but has also fostered my personal growth. I am proud to be part of NOVA IMS's community, an institution that truly values innovation and applied research.
This doctoral program was an exceptional and very rewarding experience. I would like to highlight the excellent guidance, the opportunity to learn new methodologies through interaction with renowned professionals and academics, and, without a doubt, the collaborative and welcoming academic environment. NOVA IMS was more than a school; it was the impetus for my professional development, preparing me for the challenges of an academic and research career. I am very grateful to NOVA IMS for providing me with an exceptional PhD program that has consolidated my career in the field of Information Management.
The PhD Program in Information Management at NOVA IMS provided me with the opportunity to cultivate independent research skills. The carefully crafted curriculum, tailored to the needs of each student, facilitated the development of the research work. Throughout the program,I felt completely free to explore the topics that intrigued me the most. The unwavering support from all the faculty involved, particularly my supervisor, Professor Fernando Bação, proved exceptional and instrumental to my success in the program.
NOVA IMS’ Doctoral Program in Information Management is extraordinary. Personal and professional satisfaction can be interpreted as growth. I grew in my skills alongside giants. Thank you, NOVA IMS!
NOVA IMS offers a great experience for international students. The quality of the Doctoral Program in Information Management is exceptional and very enriching, thus, providing important tools for the researcher's career. It is also important to reference the quality and motivation of the professors involved in preparing the new researchers.
As a PhD graduate from NOVA IMS, I deeply explored cybersecurity, focusing on identity protection and privacy. The program effectively bridged theory and practice in information security, aiding my academic and professional development. I gained invaluable experience in publishing and presenting at top IS journals and conferences. Now, as a cybersecurity professor, I impart these insights to a new generation of students. This journey at NOVA IMS was transformative, equipping me to tackle contemporary cybersecurity challenges with confidence. To future PhD students at NOVA IMS: you are embarking on a journey that will inspire and challenge you, preparing you for a dynamic and rewarding career in information management.
The experience was personally enriching, unique, and fulfilling. The level of engagement, and interaction that I received from the faculty, helped prepare me for an excellent academic and research career path. Indeed, the Doctoral Program provides rigorous methodology training, dedicated supervision, as well as a robust research environment exemplified by regular seminars.
