In this field, please mention: In which way your background (academic and professional) fits the program; What are your short-term professional goals; What are your expectations with the attendance of this program. Admission How does the selection process work? The selection process is based on the analysis of the academic and professional curriculum .

In case I am contacted for an interview, can it be held at distance? Yes, the interview can be held at distance, preferably by Zoom. When will I know the result of the application? The result of the application will be known, through email, in the date to be announced in the confirmation of submitted application email and/or by the Admissions’ Jury/Programs Manager.

After choosing the desired program and paying the pre-registration fee, you must select the option \"Withdrawal\" in the 2 nd program in which you do not intend to attend. Thus, your vacancy is available to a candidate on the Waiting List. I'm on the Waiting List. Can I still be admitted? Since it is possible for candidates to apply for two programs per application phase, there will be cases where the same candidate has been admitted to both programs, but intends to join only one. In these cases and if the limit number of vacancies is not completed, the remaining vacancy will be assigned to a candidate on the Waiting List.
