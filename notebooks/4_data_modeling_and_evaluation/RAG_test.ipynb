For information about the International Student Access, please click here . Program Goals The bachelor's degree in Data Science aims to strengthen the intermediate step between data collection and decision making based on them, i.e. to develop advanced methods of data science and artificial intelligence. To this end, the course of study adopts a primarily technical perspective. The goal is to provide in-depth knowledge of the fundamental methodologies and concepts, in order to provide the student with the ability to update more specific technical knowledge and to keep up with the rapid evolution of this sector. In this context, the graduate in Data Science should: Understand the theoretical foundations of statistics, Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence methods; Identify and understand the most efficient algorithm for each specific problem; Design and develop state-of-the-art data science algorithms; Work closely with IT specialists to integrate Data Science algorithms into existing systems; Identify underlying patterns and extract useful information from the large volume of heterogeneous data that exists in organizations; Be proficient in commonly used statistical procedures, frameworks, machine learning techniques and systems; Stimulate interest in keeping up with scientific advances in the field of Data Science and Artificial Intelligence. Program Structure The course lasts 3 years (6 semesters) and classes start in September 2025. The study plan corresponds to 180 ECTS, of which 150 ECTS correspond to mandatory curricular units (the first 5 semesters) and 30 ECTS correspond to optional curricular units (last semester of the course), which will be chosen by each Student, from among a wide range of curricular units available.
