Thus, the study cycle is suitable for all students who wish to obtain in-depth training in the most recent techniques of data science and artificial intelligence, based on automatic logical reasoning, data management methods and techniques, as well as machine learning applications. The course aims to train highly specialized professionals who will enable organizations to take advantage of the huge volume of data they currently have at their disposal. Program Goals The bachelor's degree in Data Science aims to strengthen the intermediate step between data collection and decision making based on them, i.e. to develop advanced methods of data science and artificial intelligence. To this end, the course of study adopts a primarily technical perspective. The goal is to provide in-depth knowledge of the fundamental methodologies and concepts, in order to provide the student with the ability to update more specific technical knowledge and to keep up with the rapid evolution of this sector. In this context, the graduate in Data Science should: Understand the theoretical foundations of statistics, Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence methods; Identify and understand the most efficient algorithm for each specific problem; Design and develop state-of-the-art data science algorithms; Work closely with IT specialists to integrate Data Science algorithms into existing systems; Identify underlying patterns and extract useful information from the large volume of heterogeneous data that exists in organizations; Be proficient in commonly used statistical procedures, frameworks, machine learning techniques and systems; Stimulate interest in keeping up with scientific advances in the field of Data Science and Artificial Intelligence. Program Structure The course lasts 3 years (6 semesters) and classes start in September 2025. The study plan corresponds to 180 ECTS, of which 150 ECTS correspond to mandatory curricular units (the first 5 semesters) and 30 ECTS correspond to optional curricular units (last semester of the course), which will be chosen by each Student, from among a wide range of curricular units available.\"),\n",

Thus, the study cycle is suitable for all students who wish to obtain in-depth training in the most recent techniques of data science and artificial intelligence, based on automatic logical reasoning, data management methods and techniques, as well as machine learning applications. The course aims to train highly specialized professionals who will enable organizations to take advantage of the huge volume of data they currently have at their disposal. Program Goals The bachelor's degree in Data Science aims to strengthen the intermediate step between data collection and decision making based on them, i.e. to develop advanced methods of data science and artificial intelligence. To this end, the course of study adopts a primarily technical perspective. The goal is to provide in-depth knowledge of the fundamental methodologies and concepts, in order to provide the student with the ability to update more specific technical knowledge and to keep up with the rapid evolution of this sector. In this context, the graduate in Data Science should: Understand the theoretical foundations of statistics, Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence methods; Identify and understand the most efficient algorithm for each specific problem; Design and develop state-of-the-art data science algorithms; Work closely with IT specialists to integrate Data Science algorithms into existing systems; Identify underlying patterns and extract useful information from the large volume of heterogeneous data that exists in organizations; Be proficient in commonly used statistical procedures, frameworks, machine learning techniques and systems; Stimulate interest in keeping up with scientific advances in the field of Data Science and Artificial Intelligence. Program Structure The course lasts 3 years (6 semesters) and classes start in September 2025. The study plan corresponds to 180 ECTS, of which 150 ECTS correspond to mandatory curricular units (the first 5 semesters) and 30 ECTS correspond to optional curricular units (last semester of the course), which will be chosen by each Student, from among a wide range of curricular units available.\"),\n",

Degree In Information Management With A Specialization In Information Systems Management. This is because the program does not require applicants to have a background in management specifically. Instead, it focuses on providing individuals with the necessary skills and knowledge to effectively manage information systems. Therefore, as long as professionals have a strong foundation in areas such as mathematics, logic, and problem-solving, they should be well-positioned to succeed in this program.   \n",

the application fee and the tuition fee. The application fee is €51, while the tuition fee varies depending on the applicant's nationality. For applicants with a nationality from a European Union member country, the tuition fee is €4,200. For applicants of other nationalities, the tuition fee is €4,900. Therefore, the total cost of the postgraduate program in data science for finance varies depending on the applicant's nationality, but it includes both the application fee and the tuition fee.   \n",

postgraduate program in data science for finance. For instance, a student who chooses to pay the tuition fee in a single payment has a 2,5% discount on the payable amount. This student can also benefit from NOVA IMS’ alumni discount of 20%, cumulative with the financial discount. Companies that finance the education of their employees can also take advantage of various discounts.
